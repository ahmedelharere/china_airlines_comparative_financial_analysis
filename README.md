## 📈 Key Findings
- EVA significantly outperforms CAL in **ROE (19.7% vs. 8.8% in 2023)** due to higher net margins and lower reliance on debt.
- CAL’s high **Debt-to-Equity (129%)** raises financial risk despite government ownership.
- DDM valuation estimates **fair value at NT$25.39**, close to the market price (NT$26.00).
- Strategic focus: **cost efficiency + premium service differentiation**.
