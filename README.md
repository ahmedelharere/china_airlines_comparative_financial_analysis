# China Airlines – Comparative Financial Analysis

This project is a financial modeling and competitive analysis of **China Airlines (CAL)** versus its main competitor, **EVA Airways**.  
It was developed as part of my coursework at Minerva University for **B111: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Modeling**.

## 📊 Contents
- **DuPont Analysis** (ROE breakdown: Net Margin, Asset Turnover, Equity Multiplier)
- **Capital Structure Analysis** (Debt-to-Equity, Cost structure, COGS-to-Revenue)
- **Dividend Discount Model (DDM)** valuation with sensitivity analysis
- **Strategic Recommendations** for CAL’s profitability and efficiency improvement

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (financial modeling, ratio analysis, DDM valuation)
- Python (data validation and charting – optional)
- Report written in LaTeX/Word → exported to PDF

## 📈 Key Findings
- EVA significantly outperforms CAL in **ROE (19.7% vs. 8.8% in 2023)** due to higher net margins and lower reliance on debt.
- CAL’s high **Debt-to-Equity (129%)** raises financial risk despite government ownership.
- DDM valuation estimates **fair value at NT$25.39**, close to the market price (NT$26.00).
- Strategic focus: **cost efficiency + premium service differentiation**.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Automate ratio calculations using Python/pandas.
- Expand valuation with DCF modeling alongside DDM.
- Add visualization dashboards (Tableau/PowerBI).
